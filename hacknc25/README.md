# HackNC 2025 - ruSSH

ruSSH is an old-school terminal-based roguelike game where the player must equip gear, battle monsters, and navigate through a series of randomly-generated dungeons to emerge victorious.

- Players will go through a simple character creation process at the start of the game, which will affect their stats.
- Different enemy types have different behaviors and deal different amounts of damage.
- Items spawn randomly on the map and can be picked up by the player.
